      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is completely undeniable and also completely naive to deny that LLMs and foundational models have changed the course of the Deep learning research. I think one can draw a line where you have papers before the first GPT model was out  and papers after. You will see a clear difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A field that also dramatically changed because of the surge of LLMs&#xA;is NLP.&#xA;One can easily claim that more than a half of research in NLP is&#xA;now about prompting LLM for a task that before required extensive&#xA;architecture designing and large datasets.&#xA;The rest of NLP research would largely revolve around the&#xA;properties of LLMs or (engineering) new better and faster LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
